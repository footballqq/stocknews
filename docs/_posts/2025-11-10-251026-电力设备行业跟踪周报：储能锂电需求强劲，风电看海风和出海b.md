I have read the content of `wxpubprompt.txt`. It provides detailed instructions for transforming a given document into a popular WeChat public account article. The persona is a "senior financial journalist + comedian" with a humorous, slightly sarcastic, data-driven, yet objective tone. The target audience is financial novices and advanced investors. The goal is to create an engaging, story-driven article that is easy to understand, provides actionable advice (without being investment advice), and encourages sharing. The output should include title options, an introduction, a main body of 3000-5000 words, a one-screen summary, concluding remarks, and prompts for reader interaction.

Now, I need to read the PDF file specified in the user's request: `C:\Users\qixin\Downloads\temp\doc\251026 电力设备行业跟踪周报：储能锂电需求强劲，风电看海风和出海b.pdf`.
After reading the PDF, I will use its content along with the instructions from `wxpubprompt.txt` to generate the article.
